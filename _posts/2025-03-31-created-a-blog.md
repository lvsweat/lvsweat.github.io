I have finally created a blog. To be honest when going into it, I thought it would be pretty corny, and generally pointless.
However, It was an interesting experience playing around with GitHub pages and trying to get a functional template that works for what I want.

I am still skeptical of the effects this will have on my career, but I am hopeful, as I feel I am running out of things to try when it comes to attempts at getting my foot just into the door in the industry.

## *Some* Background

When growing up I found myself fascinated by how things work. I would do things like take my toys apart trying to understand how they work and think about how whatever video game I was playing works, and wanted to make something like a video game myself.

Fortunately, thanks to my parents, I got my hands on a computer one day, and of course, started my online journey just by playing video games. I at some point or another started trying to figure out how those games work though, or rather, how I can make my own.

I started with Unity3D. I think it was just before Unity 5 came out when I started playing around with it. I began to watch YouTube tutorials about how to make games, and eventually specific mechanics, not so much trying to understand how they worked yet, but more so just trying to make something functional because it was cool. I remember copying and pasting various scripts in javascript from various YouTube tutorials and such. I felt cool.

Anywho, fast forward to around 2018 or 2019, I found myself on a social game that will not be named here, and I would run into people on said game that could do things that others couldn't, which was cool to me.
At first it was smaller simpler things like exploits that revolved around really basic and unavoidable vulnerabilities due to the nature of the game,  but it started to transition into being around the community that had more interest in modifying the actual game itself rather than working with what was already there.

I gained interest in how to start essentially "cheating" in this game (despite it being a social game). I felt relatively confident going into it due to my previous "experience" with Unity, especially after learning the game was also made using Unity.

Over the following 2 or so years I spent my time learning how to program in C# by looking through other peoples' "cheats" and mods, just trying to sit there and figure out how all these words and symbols come together and function to create the end result.

Eventually, I started getting the hang of things on my own and began writing mods for myself. Some were more interconnected than others, involving things like a full RESTful API, websocket, virtual currency, modifications that haven't been seen in the game before, and various projects that I would actually occasionally sell for others to use.

Over time, as I began branching out and learning other things that I tied into my mods, I started gaining more interest in general software engineering outside of video games. 
That eventually brought me to embedded software engineering and learning more low-level stuff like C++ and even some assembly for some other projects.

Programming became a passion for me very quickly. Pulling all-nighters just to finish a segment of whatever project I am working on despite there being no deadline or pressure, trying to figure out what I don't know, even learning other languages just for the fun of it after hearing about them from friends. Rust is an example of my learning a language just for the sake of it for the most part. I can't say I am all that great at it, but I love Rust.

Over the past 2 or 3 years, I have been trying to apply myself and get a job in the industry after investing so much of my time into programming. I felt it would be a great thing to do. I am passionate about programming, and hey, I can get paid for it?? Sweet.

Well, over the past 2 or 3 years, I have yet to land a single interview. It has been brutal, frustrating, and I have even given up a handful of times.

I started reaching out to friends who already have jobs in the industry, asking what is wrong with my resume, what can I be doing better, how can I better position myself for an application or opportunity, and it has all seemingly done little to nothing for me.

Recently I was motivated once more to take up the task of trying again. This time more intently and more organized, almost treating the act of job hunting like a job itself.

Part of that included an idea from a friend, that was to create a blog, just to put content out there and talk about my experience, and my projects.

I haven't gone to any college, and the most I have to show for my formal education is a high school diploma, so the extent of my knowledge goes as far as what I have taken an interest in with various fields in IT.

I feel my lack of a degree in something may be the problem as I have heard so often, but I can't be for sure considering how often I have also heard that friends or others have gotten jobs just fine without a degree.

This concludes my brain/word vomit for the night.



## TLDR

I created this blog because I haven't had any luck getting my foot in the door in IT, so my friends told me to make this.
